## 04- Negative Numbers Merge Sort Challenge
### Challenge Description
This is a coding challenge involving the implementation of a merge sort algorithm with a specific condition. Given an array arr_test containing both positive and negative numbers, the goal is to sort the array in a way that the negative numbers appear first, followed by the positive numbers while preserving their original order within each group.
### Challenge Explanation
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm while maintaining the order of negative and positive numbers within the array. The algorithm splits the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges them while keeping the desired order.
### How to Run
To test the solution, modify the arr_test array with your desired input and run the script. The output will display the original array and the sorted array with negative numbers appearing first.

# 05-Standard Deviation â€“ Code

## Description

This Python code calculates the standard deviation of a set of numerical values entered by the user. Standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the values in a dataset are. This code performs the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes several variables, including `sd` (standard deviation), `ava` (average), `a`, and `b`.

2. **Input**: It prompts the user to input the number of values they want to enter (`n`), and then it enters `n` numerical values into the list `x`.

3. **Calculation of Average**: It calculates the average (`ava`) of the entered values.

4. **Calculation of Variance**: It computes the variance (`a`) of the values, which measures how much the individual values deviate from the mean.

5. **Calculation of Standard Deviation**: Finally, it calculates the standard deviation (`sd`) by taking the square root of the variance. The standard deviation provides a measure of the overall dispersion of the data.

6. **Output**: It prints the calculated standard deviation as the result.

This code can be useful in various statistical and data analysis tasks to understand the distribution and spread of data points in a dataset. It provides a clear example of how to calculate standard deviation in Python and can serve as a reference for similar calculations.
