## 04- Negative Numbers Merge Sort Challenge
### Challenge Description
This is a coding challenge involving the implementation of a merge sort algorithm with a specific condition. Given an array arr_test containing both positive and negative numbers, the goal is to sort the array in a way that the negative numbers appear first, followed by the positive numbers, while preserving their original order within each group.
### Challenge Explanation
The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm while maintaining the order of negative and positive numbers within the array. The algorithm splits the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges them while keeping the desired order.
### How to Run
To test the solution, modify the arr_test array with your desired input and run the script. The output will display the original array and the sorted array with negative numbers appearing first.
